        Grayscale image in which spots should be detected.

          You can either enhance spots only within their plane (2D)
          or alternatively with the including information from adjacent
          planes (3D), as described by Raj et al. 2009.

    - name: spot_size
      type: Numeric

      help: >
          Approximate size of spots (diameter in pixels). A Laplacian of
          Gaussian filter of this size will be used to enhance the radial
          signal of that size.

      help: >
          Number of z-planes to use in image filter (in case of 3D filter).

      value: [0.01, 0.99]
      help: >
          Prior to spot detection the images are rescaled according to their
          intensity using quantiles. [0 1] would correspond to using the
          single dimmest pixel for minimal intensity and the single brightest
          pixel for maximal intensity. [0.01 0.90] would mean that the minimum
          intensity is derived from the 1% brightest pixel and that the
          maximum intensity is derived from the 90% brightest
          pixel.

      value: [0, 120, 500, 0]
      help: >
          Most extreme values that the image intensity minimum and image
          intensity maximum (as defined by the quanta) are allowed to
          have [LowestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMinimum
          HighestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMinimum
          LowestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMaximum
          HighestPossibleGreyscaleValueForImageMaximum].
          To ignore an individual value, and use per-image quantile
          rescaling, place 0.

    - name: detection_threshold
      type: Numeric
      value: 0.08
      help: >
          Threshold for spot detection intensity in rescaled image on a scale
          of 0-1 (default: 0.02). Spots in the rescaled / LoG-filtered image
          with intensity below this value will not be detected.

          2D representation of 3D spots. Pixel values correspond to number
          of spots detected at each x-y position. Image can be summed to get
          spot-count.
