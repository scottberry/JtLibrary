    help: >
      Labeled image encoding primary objects that should be used as seeds for
      the detection of secondary objects.

  - name: intensity_image
    type: IntensityImage
    key:
    help: >
      Grayscale image that should be used to find the outlines of secondary
      objects.

  - name: threshold
    type: Numeric
    value: 125
    help: >
      Maximum value of background.

  - name: method
    type: Scalar
    value: propagation
    options:
      - propagation
      - watershed_gradient
      - watershed_image
      - distance_n
      - distance_b
    help: >
      Segmentation method.

  - name: regularization_factor
    type: Numeric
    value: 0.01
    help: >
      Used only for 'propagation' method. Larger values cause the distance
      between objects to be more important than the intensity image in
      determining cut lines. Smaller values cause the intensity image to
      be more important than the distance between objects.

  - name: distance_to_dilate
    type: Numeric
    value: 3
    help: >
      Used only for 'distance_n', 'distance_b' methods. The number of
      pixels by which the primary objects will be expanded.

  - name: fill_holes
    type: Boolean
    value: true
    help: Should holes in the secondary objects be filled?

  - name: plot
    type: Plot
    value: false
    help: Should a figure be created?

    help: Labeled image encoding secondary objects.

  - name: figure
    type: Figure
    help: >
      Comparison of "primary_label_image" and "secondary_label_image". Also
      shows outlines of objects in "secondary_label_image" on "intensity_image".
