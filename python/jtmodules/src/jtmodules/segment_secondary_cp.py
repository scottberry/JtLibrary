    Parameters
    ----------
    primary_label_image: numpy.ndarray[numpy.int32]
        2D labeled array encoding primary objects, which serve as seeds for
        watershed transform
    intensity_image: numpy.ndarray[numpy.uint8 or numpy.uint16]
        2D grayscale array that serves as gradient for watershed transform;
        optimally this image is enhanced with a low-pass filter
    method: str
        one of ['propagation', 'watershed_gradient', 'watershed_image',
        'watershed_gradient', 'distance_n', 'distance_b'] specifying which
        segmentation method to use
    threshold: int
        maximum background value; pixels above `threshold` are considered
        foreground
    regularization_factor: float, optional
        used only for 'propagation' method. Larger values cause the distance
        between objects to be more important than the intensity image in
        determining cut lines. Smaller values cause the intensity image to
        be more important than the distance between objects.
    distance_to_dilate: int, optional
        used only for 'distance_n', 'distance_b' methods. The number of
        pixels by which the primary objects will be expanded.
    fill_holes: bool, optional
        whether holes should be filled in the secondary objects
    plot: bool, optional
        whether a plot should be generated

    Returns
    -------

    Original text from CellProfiler module:

    There are several methods available to find the dividing lines between
    secondary objects that touch each other:
    -  propagation: This method will find dividing lines between
       clumped objects where the image stained for secondary objects shows a
       change in staining (i.e., either a dimmer or a brighter line).
       Smoother lines work better, but unlike the Watershed method, small
       gaps are tolerated. This method is considered an improvement on the
       traditional Watershed method. The dividing lines between objects
       are determined by a combination of the distance to the nearest
       primary object and intensity gradients. This algorithm uses local
       image similarity to guide the location of boundaries between cells.
       Boundaries are preferentially placed where the image’s local
       appearance changes perpendicularly to the boundary (Jones et al,
       2005).
       The propagation algorithm is the default approach for secondary object
       creation. Each primary object is a "seed" for its corresponding
       secondary object, guided by the input
       image and limited to the foreground region as determined by the chosen
       thresholding method. lambda is a regularization parameter; see the help for
       the setting for more details. Propagation of secondary object labels is
       by the shortest path to an adjacent primary object from the starting
       (“seeding”) primary object. The seed-to-pixel distances are calculated
       as the sum of absolute differences in a 3x3 (8-connected) image
       neighborhood, combined with lambda via sqrt(differences^2 +
       lambda^2).
    -  watershed_gradient: This method uses the watershed algorithm
       (Vincent and Soille, 1991) to assign pixels to the primary objects
       which act as seeds for the watershed. In this variant, the watershed
       algorithm operates on the Sobel transformed image which computes an
       intensity gradient. This method works best when the image intensity
       drops off or increases rapidly near the boundary between cells.
    -  watershed_image: This method is similar to the above, but it
       uses the inverted intensity of the image for the watershed. The areas
       of lowest intensity will be detected as the boundaries between cells.
       This method works best when there is a saddle of relatively low
       intensity at the cell-cell boundary.
    -  Distance: In this method, the edges of the primary objects are
       expanded a specified distance to create the secondary objects. For
       example, if nuclei are labeled but there is no stain to help locate
       cell edges, the nuclei can simply be expanded in order to estimate
       the cell’s location. This is often called the “doughnut” or “annulus”
       or “ring” approach for identifying the cytoplasm. There are two
       methods that can be used:
       -  distance_n: In this method, the image of the secondary
          staining is not used at all; the expanded objects are the final
          secondary objects.
       -  distance_b: Thresholding of the secondary staining image
          is used to eliminate background regions from the secondary
          objects. This allows the extent of the secondary objects to be
          limited to a certain distance away from the edge of the primary
          objects without including regions of background.
